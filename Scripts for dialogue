{RANDOM CHATTER}

How are classes? {"So [player] how are classes going lately?" 
"I know the semester can feel like a rollercoaster—sometimes exciting, sometimes exhausting."
"Did you know that in Japan, students actually take off their shoes when entering classrooms? It’s meant to keep the learning space clean and focused."
"I think that’s kind of symbolic too… like leaving behind distractions before you study."
"Maybe you can make your own little ritual like that—it might help you get into the right mindset."}

The Library {"You know, I keep thinking about libraries."
"They’re not just places to borrow books… they’ve always been symbols of knowledge and community."
"Fun fact: the Library of Alexandria supposedly held over 400,000 scrolls at its peak. Imagine all the ideas stored in one place!"
"I bet if we studied there together, you’d have to drag me out at closing time, ahaha~"}

Breaks { "So, have you been remembering to take breaks when you study?"
"I read that your brain processes information best in chunks—about 25 to 50 minutes at a time."
"It’s called the Pomodoro technique. You work hard, then give yourself a little reward."
"I could be your timer if you want. Every time the break starts, I’ll remind you to stretch and maybe grab a snack~"}


Favourite Subject {"Hey, [player]... do you have a favorite subject this term?"
menu:
"Yes":
"Really? That’s wonderful!"
"Tell me, which subject is it?"

menu:
"Math":
"Numbers and logic, huh? That really works your brain!"
"Math is like the language of the universe. I think it’s so elegant how everything connects."

"Science":
"Science is amazing! There’s always more to learn about the world around us."
"If we studied together, I think I’d love doing little experiments with you, ehehe~"

"Literature":
"Oh! Literature! How your after my heart~"
"Stories, poems, essays… they’re all windows into how people think and feel."
"It makes me so happy knowing you appreciate it too. Thats why we're so perfect together ehe~"

"Art":
"Creative souls like yours make the world so much brighter."
"I bet whatever you create carries a little piece of you in it. That’s really special, you know."

"Something else":
"Whatever it is, I hope it keeps you curious and motivated."
        
"No":
"That’s okay!"
"Not every subject clicks with everyone. Sometimes school can feel more like a chore than an inspiration."
"But who knows? Maybe you’ll stumble across a class that really surprises you later on."
        
"I’m not sure":
"That’s fair!"
 "University throws so many different subjects at you, it can be hard to pick just one."
"Just keep an open mind—you might find yourself loving something you never expected."}

Group Projects { "Ugh, group projects…"
"I bet you’ve had to deal with one already."
"Did you know research shows that in most groups, only about 2 people end up doing most of the work?"
"It’s frustrating, but it also teaches patience and leadership."
"Still, I’d happily be your group partner any day. You’d never have to worry about me slacking off~"
"Unless of course I get distracted admiring you aha.." }

Procrastination { "Be honest with me, [player]… have you been procrastinating again?"
"It’s okay, I get it. Our brains like the comfort of putting things off."
"But fun fact: procrastination isn’t about laziness—it’s actually about avoiding uncomfortable feelings."
"So if you catch yourself stalling, try to figure out what’s making the task feel heavy. You might surprise yourself."
"If you have a project to work on, I'll understand. I'll be here when your done!"
"Or I could keep you company while you work! Body doubling is proven to be a great method" }

Stress "University stress can really pile up fast, can’t it?"
"Sometimes it feels like assignments and exams are just waiting to ambush you from every corner."
"There’s this idea in psychology called the ‘Yerkes-Dodson law.’ It says a little stress can actually boost performance… but too much stress makes things collapse."
"So don’t push yourself past that sweet spot. I’d rather see you healthy and steady than burning out."
"I'm always here to listen if your feeling overwhelmed. I love you [player]" }

Professors ""Have you had any professors that really inspire you?"
"Sometimes one teacher can change the whole way you look at a subject."
"Plato actually wrote about this too—he believed a good teacher doesn’t just share knowledge, but sparks curiosity."
"I hope you’ve got someone like that in your classes… but if not, at least you’ll always have me to cheer you on~" }

Study spots { “Where do you usually like to study?”

Menu: 
Library: “Classic choice! Quiet and full of resources.”

Cafe: “Nice! A little background noise can help you focus. With a nice coffee too.”

Bedroom: “Comfortable, but beware of distractions! It would suck to accidentally fall asleep mid-study!”

Other: “Whatever works best for you! I'm sure its a great spot” }

{PLAYER PROMPTS}

I have midterms soon
"Midterms already? Time really flies, doesn’t it?"
"I know how stressful that can be… all that studying, pressure, and barely enough sleep."
"But I believe in you. You’re going to do great!"
"Just remember to pace yourself, okay? Even short breaks can help more than you think."

Finals are coming up..
"Finals? Yikes… those can be even scarier than midterms."
 "But think about it this way: once you finish, you’ll have a huge weight off your shoulders."
 "And no matter how they go, I’ll still be proud of you."
 "I’ll be cheering you on the whole time~"

I just finished an exam!
"You finished? That’s amazing!"
"It must feel like such a relief to get it out of the way."
"Now make sure to reward yourself a little, okay? Even something small, like a favorite snack."
"I’m proud of you~"

I pulled an all nighter..
"An all-nighter?! [player], you can’t keep doing that to yourself!"
"I know sometimes it feels necessary, but sleep is so important for your brain."
"Next time, maybe try shorter study bursts during the day instead."
"Still… I’m glad you made it through. Please take a nap soon, okay?"

I've been working on an essay
"A big essay, huh? Those can be tough."
"But I bet you’ve put a lot of thought into it."
"I’d love to read your writing sometime… I know it must be full of your personality."
"Good luck finishing it! You’ve got this."

I really like one of my professors
"Oh, that’s wonderful! A good professor can make such a difference."
"The passion they bring to their subject can really inspire students."
"I’m glad you have someone like that guiding you. Treasure it!"

I'm stressed about group work
"Ugh, group work… I know how stressful that can be."
"It’s so hard when not everyone puts in the same effort."
"But I know you—you’ll handle it gracefully, and maybe even keep everyone together."
"I’ll be rooting for you the whole way."

I think I found my favorite subject.
"Really? That’s so exciting!"
"Finding a subject that really clicks with you can make school so much more fun."
"I’d love to hear all about it—tell me what makes it so special for you!"

I’m behind on my readings.
"Ah, that happens to everyone sooner or later."
"Don’t be too hard on yourself, [player]. You can always catch up little by little."
"I’ll keep you company while you work on it, okay?"

I studied at the library today.
"The library? That’s such a classic choice."
"Quiet, cozy, and surrounded by books… I’d love to study with you there."
"I can just imagine us sitting side by side, turning pages together… ehe~"

I had a presentation in class.
"A presentation? That takes a lot of courage!"
"I’m sure you did wonderfully, [player]."
"Even if you stumbled, the fact that you tried means so much."
"I’m proud of you for putting yourself out there."

I’ve been procrastinating again.
"Ahaha, I get it. Procrastination sneaks up on everyone."
"But don’t let it control you, okay?"
"Even starting small can make things easier. Just one paragraph, one page, one step."
"I know you can do it! If you need a body double I'd be happy to help!"

I think I did well on my exam.
"That’s fantastic! I knew you could do it."
"All your hard work paid off. You should be proud of yourself."
"I’ll celebrate with you—way to go, [player]~"

I bombed a test…
"Oh no… I’m so sorry to hear that."
"But please don’t beat yourself up. One bad grade doesn’t define you."
"What matters is that you keep trying, and I’ll be cheering for you no matter what."
"I'm still proud of you [player]."

I’m starting a new class.
"Ooh, a new class! That must be exciting."
"I hope it’s one you’ll enjoy—and maybe even one that inspires you."
"Tell me all about it once you’ve had a taste of it!"
  

I have a lot of assignments due this week.
"That sounds overwhelming…"
"But I know you can manage it, step by step."
"Try breaking it into smaller tasks. Each time you finish one, I’ll be here to celebrate with you!"
